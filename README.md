**Prompt:**
'What is the purpose of the Runner.run_sync() method?'

**Response:**
Great question! The `Runner.run_sync()` method is super useful when you're building agents and want to see them in action right away without dealing with all the complexities of asynchronous code.

**In a nutshell:** `Runner.run_sync()` lets you run your agent in a synchronous (or "blocking") way. This means that when you call `run_sync()`, your program will execute the agent step-by-step and wait for each step to complete before moving on.

**Why is this helpful?**

*   **Simpler debugging:** It makes it much easier to trace the execution of your agent, inspect variables, and understand exactly what's happening at each step.
*   **Easier to understand:** Synchronous code is generally easier to read and follow than asynchronous code, especially when you're first learning.
*   **Quick testing:** You can quickly test and iterate on your agent's behavior in a straightforward way.

**Example:**

Let's say you have an agent designed to answer questions about historical events. Using `run_sync()`, you could run the agent on a specific question and see exactly how it processes the question, which tools it uses, and how it arrives at the answer.

**Important Note:**

While `run_sync()` is great for development and debugging, it's generally **not recommended** for production environments. Synchronous execution can be slower and less efficient than asynchronous execution, especially for agents that need to perform multiple tasks concurrently. For production, you'll typically want to use the asynchronous `run()` method.

Does that explanation help clarify the purpose of `Runner.run_sync()`? Feel free to ask if you have more questions!
